# Project 4: fitX <sub><sub>by RJCAN</sub></sub>
<h4> Group 17 - EECS 448</h4>
<small> This program contains a fitness/lifestyle tracking app written in JavaScript, html, and css. </small>
<h2>Welcome to fitX!</h2>
<small> fitX is the app that lets you accomplish your physical and mental goals. It allows you to keep track of your lifestyle habits all in one place, and has a home page where you can schedule your week.</small>
<h2>Features </h2>
  <small> fitX includes a mood tracker, soreness tracker, water tracker, and nutrition tracker. It also allows you to select workout(s) or write in your own. You can specify whether you want a cardio or strength workout and then can start the workout right on the app! Each page contains a 'Save Day' button where when pressed it uploads the user inputted data to your local storage. This data will then be displayed on the index.html page in the weekly summary section.</small>

</ul>
<h2>User Instructions:</h2>
  <small> To open the app, download the zip file on the repository. In your downloads folder open the index.html file, this will take you to your preferred web-browser. Once in the web-browser you can simply switch from day-to-day by clicking on the links at the top of the page.</small>
  <h2>Next Steps:</h2>
  <small>The current application utilizes local storage which has limited storage capabilites. This causes issues when trying to reload a page with the same data it previously had stored. If this app were to become something that more users wanted then we would need to implement a database or a cloud storage system for the user data.</small>
